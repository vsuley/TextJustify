Small first paragraph. 

A slightly longer second paragraph that is less than 80 chars. 

Now,  this  should  be  a  longer  paragraph that needs some folding over to fit
within  an  80  column limit. This is now the second sentence in that relatively
short but still folded over paragraph. 

Another tiny paragraph. 



There were 4 new lines before this paragraph started. In fact, now lets throw in
some spaces for good measure: lots of spaces between the preceding colon and the
word 'lots'. 

This  paragraph  will  have  built-in  formatting in the way of single newlines.
These  newlines  should  be  ignored and the words folded in the proper width as
required by the parmeter passed in. 

This line should end with EOF.
