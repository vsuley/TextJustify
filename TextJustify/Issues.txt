Move the swap/backup file naming logic to Program.cs since it seems bit more
of UX level business logic.

Initialize StreamParser before calling justifier.Justify() in the main
program insead of initializing within the Justify method. This is for the 
sake of keeping it consistent. Justifier should be able to use the StreamParser
like a library/utility without having to worry about its internal houskeeping 
unless there is a strong reason.

If a line ends with a ':' and is within column length limit, do not reflow the 
next line up to it. As in, do not bring up the next line to the same line as
':'. At the same time, if a line has a ':' but then has text following it and 
it is all within the line limit, do not break the line either. This is because 
I want the user to be able to use ':' either way they want without having TJ mess
up their formatting.
